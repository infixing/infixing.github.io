<h4>Am I supposed to have kids?</h4>

The first time I'd ever heard of a "geriatric pregnancy" was on an episode of <em>Catastrophe</em>. Sharon Horgan's character (also named Sharon) is informed that being in her 40s puts her and her unborn child at high risk for medical complications. Sharon's pap smear is abnormal; she has <a href="https:/webmd.com/cancer/cervical-cancer/cervical-dysplasia-symptoms-causes-treatments" target="_blank" alt="opens a new window to an article about cervical dysplasia">cervical dysplasia</a>. The doctor assures that there's not much to worry about. It's not cancer, just "sort of next door" to it. She just needs to come back more often for check-ups and ensure that her cervix remains cancer-free. The next day, Sharon is still fixated on what she sarcastically describes as a "gentle half-cancer," and links it to age. Distressed, she looks to her partner for confirmation. "It's because I'm old, isn't it?"

Until quite recently, I'd never really thought about having kids, or contemplated my fertility. I was excited for my friends when they had the first, their second kids. Happy to finally have recipients of cute clothes and picture books. As for me? As well as financial stability, I was holding out for emotional maturity. And, to be honest, a reliable partner. An image kept playing in my mind, of trying to get an unwieldy stroller on the bus. In this scenario, I still don't know how to drive, or I can't afford a car. The other parent may or may not be in the picture.

These things can be planned only to a certain extent. But as it turns out, <em>not</em> getting pregnant has been easy enough. I was definitely interested in being a relationship, but bought into the idea of the heterosexual chase. Waiting to be poached, almost. On the rare occasion that I judged someone to be promising, that someone wasn't as interested. And so I would be disappointed for a bit. Then I'd get over it, and get on with my life.
