<h4>Am I supposed to have kids?</h4>

The first time I'd ever heard of a "geriatric pregnancy" was on an episode of <em>Catastrophe</em>. Sharon Horgan's character (also named Sharon) is informed that being in her 40s puts her and her unborn child at high risk for medical complications. Sharon's pap smear is abnormal; she has <a href="https:/webmd.com/cancer/cervical-cancer/cervical-dysplasia-symptoms-causes-treatments" target="_blank" alt="opens a new window to an article about cervical dysplasia">cervical dysplasia</a>. The doctor assures that there's not much to worry about. It's not cancer, just "sort of next door" to it. She just needs to come back more often for check-ups and ensure that her cervix remains cancer-free. The next day, Sharon is still fixated on what she sarcastically describes as a "gentle half-cancer," and links it to age. Distressed, she asks her partner Rob, "It's because I'm old, isn't it?"
