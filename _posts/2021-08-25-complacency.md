<h4>Cultures of Complacency</h4>

It's been a while, eh?

Short version: I moved (again). For a job (again).

Longer version: A pandemic, among other things. Some people are confused about it. In the early months, I got a call back to a city I'd never thought I'd find myself returning to. Now my credit score says I can be trusted to buy a house.

On the bus to work one morning (also in the early days) we passed by a field of ankle-length white flags. More than 200 thousand, I'd later learn. The billboard at one end of the installation asks, naively: "In America...How could this happen?" 

Look (not an excuse): life is absurd.

But a bug or a feature? I turn this over and over and next thing I know it's 2 am and I have to force myself to sleep. I've been having lots of dreams about work. A friend of mine suggests that I keep a dream log, but I'd prefer not to commit them to paper. I'm also afraid that I haven't really processed what happened Last Time, and that Last Time is informing much of how I move about in my current role. 

That is: which battles to pick, finding a balance. There are tasks that I'm good at and also those that I enjoy, and one or two at which I excel. Unsurprisingly, there are tasks I don't particularly like or could improve at. I also know are part of the job. Having Learned from Last Time, but also because I'm fairly new to this organization, I mind my own business (mostly). Sadly, this is partially informed by admin's neglect of staff. 

The long-timers and more recent hires all point out issues common to such organizations--not enough money, time, or people--and how these are exacerbated in this especially bureaucratic context. The choir comprises admin, community members, and other services agencies, exhorting do, <em>be</b> more!
