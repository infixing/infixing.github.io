<h4>Going in circles</h4>

Midday yesterday, I sat across four people in the community room of the first library I'd worked at, 13 years ago.  I tried to maintain my composure as I fielded questions about my experiences, my skills, my goals. I tried to convey both confidence and humility, eager to bring what I've learned but hoping to learn even more. The branch manager, seated to the far right, was someone I worked with long ago. I don't think she recognized me.

Oh, yes, I'm back to where I was about this time last year. Instead of hiding in the basement, I've set up my childhood bedroom as though it were an incredibly small studio in a larger complex. I'm trying to take it all in stride--as people like to remind me, at least I've got a place to stay! Very true. This doesn't invalidate my ambivalence towards my hometown, and th changes that have occurred here in the last decade (or year, even!). Nor the discomfort I experience when it seems as though my peers are awash with an infinite amount of disposable income and unemployment deters me from fully participating (enjoying) the benefits of capitalism.

I wish I could explain how I got (back) into this situation. I'm not yet at the point where I'm able to ask or think anything beyond WHAT THE FLYING FUCK?! and maybe I won't be for a while.
