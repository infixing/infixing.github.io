				<p>What’s in a name?

Up until September 2013, this blog was called simple pleasures because I quite often forget them. Infixing, however, better captures what my writing here has come to be about: for better or worse, the display of certain “habits of thought,” primarily regarding language, place, and consumption.

“Infix” is also a nod to both to my language background and my would-have-been-linguist self.

After bouncing around in a few different countries and cities for a number of years, I have since summer 2017 found myself back in my hometown of Denver.

Featured images were taken by me unless otherwise noted.
