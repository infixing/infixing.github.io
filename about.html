  <b>Professional version</b>
As the youth services lead at a busy public library, I manage programs, activities, and collectiion development geared towards kids and teens. I work with families and educators to complement literacy efforts, and collaborate with other youth-serving organizations to provide culturally- and developmentally-sensitive services.

  <b>Personal version</b>
One of the greatest pleasures of my life is language. I like learning about etymology, the politics of translation, sociolinguistics, you name it. Perhaps relatedly, I also get a thrill from traveling. These days, a lot of my traveling takes place through reading -- still, both do wonders for the imagination.
