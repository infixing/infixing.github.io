<h4>Professional version</h4> [b]</ br>
<p>My working life has revolved around education, instruction, and information. I've worked as an ESL teacher in China and Western Europe, and as a Spanish tutor to high school students in the Denver metro area. From 2016 to 2017 I was a graduate intern fellow at a major arts institution on the west coast of the United States. Thanks to this grant, I traveled around Mexico to <a href="https://saalaccha.wordpress.com/2017/06/18/getty-intern/" alt="Link to summary about Getty-funded Mexico trip" target="_blank">explore visual heritage documentation and photography archives</a>.

<h4>Personal version</h4> </ br>
<p><em>Infix</em> refers to my tendency to overthink things, as well as a feature of my first language. It's also a nod to my would-be linguist self.</p>
