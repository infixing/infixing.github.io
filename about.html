<h4>Professional version</h4></ br>
<p>My working life has revolved around education, instruction, and information. I've worked as an ESL teacher in China and Western Europe, and as a Spanish tutor to high school students in the Denver metro area. From 2016 to 2017 I was a graduate intern fellow focusing on <a href="https://saalaccha.wordpress.com/2017/06/18/getty-intern/" alt="Link to summary about Getty-funded Mexico trip" target="_blank">visual heritage documentation and photography archives in Mexico</a>.</p>

<p?At present, I work with kids and teens at an large public instituion on the U.S. east coast.</p>

<p><h4>Personal version</h4> </ br>
<p><em>Infix</em> refers to my tendency to overthink things, as well as a feature of my first language. It's also a nod to my would-be linguist self. I've ranked in the top 10 in Duolingo's Diamond League, but never no. 1.</p>
