  <h4>Professional version</h4> </ br>
<p>I manage programs, activities, and collection development for kids and teens at a busy urban library. I work with families, educators, and folks from other youth-oriented organizations to provide culturally-responsive and developmentally-appropriate services.

<h4>Personal version</h4> </ br>
<p><em>Infix</em> refers to my tendency to overthink things, as well as a feature of my first language. It's also a nod to my would-be linguist self.</p>
