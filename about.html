<h4>Professional version</h4></ br>
<p>My facility with languages has enabled me to help from folks develop and refine their skills in English, Spanish, and French. In both the U.S. and abroad, I've worked with toddlers and middle-school students, as well as undergraduates and businesspeople. I've also worked in the cultural heritage sector, researching <a href="https://saalaccha.wordpress.com/2017/06/18/getty-intern/" alt="Link to summary about Getty-funded Mexico trip" target="_blank">visual heritage documentation</a>, as well as facilitating artmaking workshops for youth and families.</p>

<p>At present, I work with kids and teens at an large public instituion on the U.S. east coast.</p>

<p><h4>Personal version</h4> </ br>
<p><em>Infix</em> refers to my tendency to overthink things, as well as a feature of my first language. It's also a nod to my would-be linguist self. I've ranked in the top 10 in Duolingo's Diamond League, but never no. 1.</p>
