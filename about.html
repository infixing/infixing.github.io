<h4>Professional version</h4></ br>
<p>I'm a librarian at a large public instituion on the U.S. east coast. Before this, I'd taught Spanish and ESL/EFL.</p>

<p><h4>Personal version</h4> </ br>
<p><em>Infix</em> refers to my tendency to overthink things, as well as a feature of my first language. It's also a nod to my would-be linguist self. I've ranked in the top 10 in Duolingo's Diamond League, but never no. 1.</p>
