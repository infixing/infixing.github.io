  <h4>Professional version</h4> </ br>
<p>I manage programs, activities, and collection development for kids and teens at a busy urban library. I work with families, educators, and folks from other youth-oriented organizations to provide culturally-responsive and developmentally-appropriate services.

<h4>Personal version</h4> </ br>
<p>One of the greatest pleasures of my life is language. I like learning about etymology, the politics of translation, sociolinguistics, you name it. Perhaps relatedly, I also get a thrill from traveling. These days, a lot of my traveling takes place through reading. Both do wonders for the imagination.
