Most of the action revolves around planning for the party; while the focus is on Anisa, her passion for baking, and her Pakistani roots, I appreciate the descriptions of the other students' contributions. A misunderstanding leads Anisa to assume the worst about her best friend, although this is (as expected) resolved at the end. A breezy, illustrated chapter book about friendship and accountability, for early middle grade readers. The appendix includes a glossary and instructions for activities depicted in the story (including recipes).
