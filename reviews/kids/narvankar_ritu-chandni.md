<span class="book1"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/yalibooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ritu-weds-chandni_cover.png?w=2400&ssl=1" width="147" height="100" alt="cover of Ritu Weds Chandni by Ameya Narvankar"></span>A young girl named Ayesha sees only love between her Ritu didi (older female cousin) and Chandni, and asks an aunt why some of their relatives are not at the party. Resistance to the union extends to the wider community too,, but Ayesha makes it known that despite the hate the celebration must go on. At the end of the book the author includes a glossary for non-Hindi speakers, as well as a brief note about why such stories are necessary. And I agree: while there is a growing number of works for children featuring queer protagonists, there remains a dearth of stories centering those in countries and with cultures that are not Anglo-American or Western European. This makes  RUTU AND CHANDNI not just an excellent addition to childrenâ€™s literature, but also contributes to more expansive understandings of loving and being.
