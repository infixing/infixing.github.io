On the surface, she’s right: Deena and her brother have a roof over their heads, parents who are doing their best, and a wider community of Pakistani Americans in Falls Church, Virginia. Still, kids the world over know otherwise, even those like Deena who live in relative privilege. They aren’t always afforded the opportunity to express this emotion in a healthy manner, if at all. Deena’s stress manifests itself physically—in her nighttime teeth clenching and persistent nausea during the daytime. It’s unclear, too, whether the seventh-grader finds any relief by creating art. Despite an obvious talent for drawing, internal drive, and encouragement from friends and teachers, Deena remains unsure of the validity of her pursuits. Possible resolutions to these issues are introduced about halfway, including a budding relationship with a fellow Desi artist and mentor figure. Although Deena’s anxiety isn’t officially diagnosed until well after the midpoint, it’s a minor flaw in an otherwise extremely relatable story.
