While a few names (Faridah Àbíké-Íyímídé, Tracey Baptiste, and Camryn Garrett) may be familiar to American readers, the anthology can serve as an introduction to the works of its other contributors. Most offer breezy slice-of-life narratives about family, friends, and trusting yourself. In Alex Wheatle’s winning opening story, the baker protagonist goes to great lengths to source an ingredient; its sole accompanying image, by Arantza Peña Popo, brilliantly captures the character’s resolve. Equally on the mark are Michael Kennedy’s illustrations of a bespectacled Dracula for Funbmi Otomayo’s delightful tale about a tween’s desire to attend a Halloween dance. Other contributions are more direct celebrations of heritage (including recipes for jollof rice and plantain moi moi), as well as exhortations for the future. The collection’s joyful nature may inspire readers to rejoice in their own stories and make space for others to do the same.
