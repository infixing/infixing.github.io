A young boy named Felix is at a loss, stuffing his feelings into his suitcase. This is a cute reference to the emotional baggage that many of us may carry. It’s interesting that unlike the original Slovenian and other translations, the English-language title foregoes ‘baggage’ in favor of ‘rain’; perhaps the latter is a more child-friendly term to relate to being sad. Regardless,  Dunja Jogan’s dreamy illustrations and Olivia Henwell’s rendering of Jogan’s text help readers to navigate emotions and experiences that are often stigmatized in the wider society.
