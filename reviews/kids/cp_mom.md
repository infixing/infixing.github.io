<span class="book1"><img src="https://www.childsplay.com.au/images/Up%20and%20Down%20Mom350.jpg" width="147" height="144.88" alt="cover of Up and Down Mom by Child's Play Australia"></span>The story is told from the perspective of child whose mother has bipolar disorder. The grandfather who helps to care for the child compares bipolar disorder to the “ups and downs” of a rollercoaster, hence the title and cover image. The  language is straightforward but not simplistic, and I appreciate that the presence of a counselor and a social worker are mentioned nonchalantly, The text itself is thoughtfully placed throughout the pages, allowing the reader to see just how well Summer Macon’s tender illustrations accompany the story. While the FAQ at the end of the book is addressed towards younger readers, the information is helpful for readers of all ages.  UP AND DOWN MOM is not exactly a feel-good book or a cutesy one. However, it DOES cover an important subject, and makes for a welcome addition to conversations about mental health.
