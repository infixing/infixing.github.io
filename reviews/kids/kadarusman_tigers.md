She’s understandably frustrated; she barely knows the man, let alone the environment. As the weeks pass, Louisa’s apprehension is replaced by curiosity. Not just about the incredible surroundings (this U.S.-based reader was introduced to so many flora and fauna), but also the deep ties that her own family has with the land. Kadarusman offers a compelling story that deftly combines environmentalism, empathy, and the importance of standing up for your beliefs. I appreciate the inclusion of the neurodiversity and neurodiverse individuals (Colin, a boy who Louisa befriends, is on the autism spectrum). Kudos also to the author for having characters recognize, however briefly, the land rights of Aboriginal Australians. Some readers may be put off by this, as a kind of virtue signaling. In the context of the story, however, it makes perfect sense. All in all, a great read with warm, lyrical prose that doesn’t miss a beat.
