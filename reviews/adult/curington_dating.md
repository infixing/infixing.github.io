<span class="book1"><img src="https://images.ucpress.edu/covers/isbn13/9780520293458.jpg" width="100" height="147" alt="cover of The Dating Divide"></span>Before dedicating a chapter each to the experiences of White, Black, Asian, Latinx, and multiracial daters, the authors examine how race and racialization in the U.S. has shaped the courtship patterns in the country. Those already familiar with critical race theory may want to skip ahead. A skim might still prove helpful, as these first chapters do offer solid grounding for the rest of the book. While most of the data focuses on heterosexual respondents, readers of all orientations will likely not be surprised by how White supremacy—in particular, anti-Blackness—transfer to digital spaces. Indeed, some may recognize similar experiences, and feel slight relief that they’re not alone.
