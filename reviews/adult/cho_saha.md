<span class="book1"><img src="https://cdn2.wwnorton.com/wwnproducts/LIVERT/1/1/9781324094111/9781324094111_300.jpg" width="100" height="147" alt="cover of Saha by Nam-joo Cho"></span>Like other reviewers who are familiar with KIM JI-YOUNG: BORN 1982, I was excited to read Cho Nam-joo's latest novel, and was even more intrigued by reading the description. A dystopian critique of social hierarchies? SIGN ME UP! If character development is your thing, then SAHA is most definitely worth your time, as it's less a plot-driven novel than a collection of interrelated vignettes focusing on the residents of the titular estate. Kudos to translator Jamie Chang for beautifully conveys each character's personality. (I don't read Korean, so I'm going to give Chang's version the benefit of the doubt.) My sole critique concerns the rather abrupt ending. While I appreciate the reference to the "Butterfly Riot" mentioned earlier in the story, I do wish that this last scene--or even the aftermath--was more fully fleshed out.
