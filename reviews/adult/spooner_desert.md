<span class="book1"><img src="https://www.harpercollins.com/cdn/shop/files/9780358659112_5d5a1460-c1fa-4693-8398-ef5f224b355b.jpg" width="100" height="147" alt="cover of The High Desert by James Spooner"></span>Recounting his high school years, James Spooner outlines the particular loneliness of being a mixed-raced kid in a small town. His first forays into punk compounds these feelings of isolation; despite punk's reputation as a haven for misfits, those misfits tend to be straight, white kids. I enjoyed reading THE HIGH DESERT as I learned about (and have been disenchanted by) alternative subcultures in much the same fashion. Other BIPOC who have had similar experiences as being the only, or one of few, might get a kick out of this book as well.
