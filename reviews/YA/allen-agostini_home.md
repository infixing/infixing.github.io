<span class="book1"><img src="https://lisaallen-agostini.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/home-home-new-cover.jpg" width="100" height="147" alt="cover of Home Home by Lisa-Allen Angostini"></span>With a title like HOME HOME I initially thought that this would be a typical coming-of-age story featuring an immigrant teen, There’s certainly a lot of discussion regarding belonging; the MC is a Trinidadian teen temporarily living with her queer aunts in Edmonton. She’s still unsure about fitting in, or going back “home home”—who can’t relate to that? I was pleasantly surprised by Allen-Agostini’s added focus on mental health, in the sense that there are still few YA titles with MCs of colour and/or immigrant background speaking plainly about these challenges. The descriptions in the story are quite raw, and may be triggering for some readers. For others, they may also provide solace.
