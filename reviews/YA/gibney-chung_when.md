Books on adoption, especially those geared toward much younger readers, tend to focus on caregivers and on “good” feelings, with some narratives bordering on saviorism. In contrast, each of the 15 stories in this volume provides a glimpse into the complexity of adoptees’ experiences. Genres range from slice-of-life to the supernatural and more fantastical, and one story is presented as a comic. A handful of protagonists identify as Black, Indigenous, or Latine, while the majority cue as being of different Asian heritages. There is more variety in family composition, which includes fellow adopted siblings, same-sex parents, and single-­parent households. Contributors include Meredith Ireland, Mark Oshiro, Eric Smith, and Mariama J. Lockington. The beauty of collections like this is that its contents can be read in any order, lending themselves to deep contemplation as much as leisurely reading. While some stories are more well-executed than others, taken together they remind readers that each of us is the expert in our own experience.</span>
